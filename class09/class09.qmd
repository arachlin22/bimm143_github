## Exploratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset. 
Now, we will input the skimr package.

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The variable that appears to be on a different scale to the majority, I would say, is the `winpercent` variable, since it appears to be whole numbers versus all the other variables being decimal.

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

```{r}
candy$chocolate
```

I believe the one and zero would represent if the candy has chocolate in it, as not all candy types are chocolate-based.

Now, a ggplot of a histogram will be used to visualize the data for explanatory analysis.

>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values.

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill="lightblue")
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution is not symmetrical.

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
Median is lower than 50%, but the mean is higher than 50%, so, if following the median, is no.

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
summary(choc.candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruit.candy <- candy[fruit.inds, ]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
summary(fruit.candy$winpercent)
```
The mean for the fruity candy is much lower than that of chocolate, as the chocolate is about 60.92, while fruity is 44.12.

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```

It has a p-value below 0.05, meaning that the results are statistically significant.

## 3. Overall Candy Rankings.

```{r}
head(candy$winpercent)
```

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x, decreasing = T)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
candy[inds,]
```

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```
Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters.

>Q15. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

Reese's Peanut Butter cup
Reese's Miniatures	
Twix
Kit Kat	
Snickers	

>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

Here, we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate`, and `fruity` candy together, whether it is a bar or not.

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=3)
```
![My silly barplot image](mybarplot.png)
>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

>Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst.

## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

The least popular of the ones below happens to be the most expensive, which is the Nik L Nip.

##5. Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

The ones that appear to be the most anti-correlated are chocolate-fruity or fruity-chocolate.

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

```{r}
cij["chocolate","winpercent"]
```
```{r}
cij["chocolate","bar"]
```
The most positively correlated variables would be chocolate and winpercent, as when compared to the only other circle that is of the same color or darker blue, it is higher.


##6. Principal Component Analysis

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```
First main result figure is my "PCA plot".

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 4) +
  theme_bw()
```
The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation`. We can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.

```{r}
pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus.


```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)
p
```

```{r}
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 10)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```
