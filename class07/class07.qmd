Today, we will explore unsupervised machine learning methods starting with clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Clustering

To start, let's make up some data to cluster where we know what the answer should be. The `rnorm()` function will help us here.

```{r}
hist( rnorm(30, mean=-3) )
```

Return 30 numbers centered on -3 

```{r}
tmp <- c( rnorm(n=30, mean=-3),
rnorm(n=30, mean=+3) )

x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))

x
```
Make a plot of `x`

```{r}
plot(x)
```

###K-means

The main function in base R for K-means clustering is called `kmeans()`: 

```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers=2)
km
```

The `kmeans()` function returns a "list" with 9 components. You can see the named components of any list with the `attributes()` function.

```{r}
attributes(km)
```

>Q. How many points are in each cluster?

```{r}
km$size
```

>Q. Cluster assignment/membership vector?

```{r}
km$cluster
```
>Q. Cluster centers?

```{r}
km$centers
```

>Q. Make a plot of our `kmeans` results showing cluster assignment using different colors for each cluster/group of points and cluster centers.

```{r}
plot(x, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col="blue", pch=15, cex=2)
```

>Q. Run `kmeans` again on `x` and this cluster into 4 groups/clusters and plot the same result figure as above.

```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers=4)
km
```

```{r}
plot(x, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col="blue", pch=15, cex=2)
```
> **key-point**: K-means clustering is super popular but can be misused. One big limitation is that it can impose a clustering pattern on your data even if clear natural grouping don't exist- i.e. it does what you tell it to do in terms of `centers`.

### Hierarchical clustering

The main function in "base" R for hierarchical clustering is called `hclust()`.

You can't just pass our dataset as is into `hclust()`. You must give "distance matrix" as input. We can get this from the `dist()` function in R. 
```{r}
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```

The results of `hclust()` don't have a useful `print()` nethod but do have a special `plot()` method.

```{r}
plot(hc)
```

```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col="red")
```

To get our main cluster assignment (membership vector), we need to "cut" the tree at the big goalposts...

```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, h=8)
grps
```

```{r}
table(grps)
```

```{r}
plot(x, col=grps)
```
Hierarchical clustering is distinct in that the dendrogram (tree figure) can reveal the potential grouping in your data (unlike K-means)

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a common and highly useful dimensionality reduction technique used in many fields - particularly bioinformatics.

Here we will analyze some data from the UK on food consumption.

### Data import

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url)

head(x)
```

```{r}
rownames(x) <- x[,1]
x <- x[,-1]
head(x)
```


```{r}
x <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
head(x)
```

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

One conventional plot that can be useful is called a "paris" plot.

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

### PCA to the rescue

The main function in base R for PCA is `prcomp()`.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(x) )
summary(pca)
```

The `prcomp()` function returns a list object of our results with five attributes/components.

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```

The two main results in here are `pca$x` and `pca$rotation`. The first of these (`pca$x`) contains and scores of the data in the new PC axis- we use these to make our "PCA plot".

```{r}
pca$x
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
# Make a plot of pca$x with PC1 vs PC2
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel()
```
This plot appears to be showing the relationship between PC1 and PC2 when comparing it to all four countries in the U.K. Northern Ireland appears to be the major outlier in this data set.
The second major result is contained in the `pca$roration` object or component. Let's plot this to see what PCA is picking up...

```{r}
pca$rotation
```


```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```
This plot is showing the relationship between PC1 and the 17 different dimensions that are found in the data set. It appears that fruit and alcoholic drinks appear to be negative outliers, while potatoes and soft drinks appear to be positive outliers.
